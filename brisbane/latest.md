#### ResBaz Brisbane 2020 cancelled
Unfortunately in view of likely long-term restrictions on large gatherings, and because we know that most of you will be wanting to make up as much time as possible back in the lab later in the year, we have taken the decision to cancel ResBaz Brisbane 2020. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to seeing you all in 2021.
