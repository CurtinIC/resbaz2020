ResBaz Sydney 2020 has been postponed due to COVID-19.
We will be holding ResBaz in 2021.

The ResBaz organising committee have made the difficult decision to postpone our ResBaz event which was to be held at the University of Sydney in July 2020.

This decision has been taken in response to ongoing uncertainty restrictions in response to the spread of COVID-19.

We’re hunkering down to concentrate on serving our local communities. ResBaz is about the sharing of ideas and serendipity of learning across institutional and disciplinary borders. Right now, however, this is not possible. Our spirits aren’t quite as damp as a Sydney autumn, and we are looking at what we can do to support our local teaching communities as they pivot to online delivery. 

ResBaz will be back bigger and better at the University of Sydney in 2021. We’re putting ourselves on ice (not like that!) until 2021.
