# Schedule

Let [@ResBazPerth](https://twitter.com/ResBazPerth) know your ideas for streams and electives topics by tweeting us, and using the hashtag #PerthResBaz .

To get an idea of what we typically offer at a face-to-face ResBaz, you can check out last year's schedule [here](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/perth/#schedule).

This year we are working on running various shorter, virtual sessions, distributed over the rest of the year.
So to stay up-to-date with upcoming virtual training you can join our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/cpLx6r) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ResBazPerth). You can also check back here as we will endeavour to list to upcoming training below.
