# About

The Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research. Throughout 2020 events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

Perth's ResBaz is a low-cost, 3-day intensive festival and (un-)conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. 

ResBaz Perth 2020 will be hosted by the Edith Cowan University in early July, venue TBC.
